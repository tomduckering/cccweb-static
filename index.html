    <p>Thanks for visiting out website. Sadly we're not running a Sunday service in Clapham at the moment.</p>
    <p>We are however part of the Co-Mission network. It's a family of great Bible teaching, Christ adoring churches in central and south west London. We'd be really happy to recommend some to you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="churchname">Christ Church Earlsfield</span> - A number of us have gone with our minister to our sister church in Earlsfield. They're a friendly church who meet in the morning with mix of ages and backgrounds.</li>
      <li><span class="churchname">The Boathouse Putney</span> - a few others have gone to the join a small church in Putney. It's a small, relatively young church who meet in the evenings near the river in Putney.</li>
      <li><span class="churchname">Christ Church Mayfair</span> - others have gone here. It's a larger central London church with services in the morning (good for families) and evening (good for students and young professionals).</li>
      <li><span class="churchname">Christ Church Balham</span> - some have joined this church. They are a well established church with people from a variety of backgrounds. Their main meeting is in the morning and they have a supplimentary evening service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are still a number of us in the Clapham area. If you'd like to get in touch, we'd be happy to hear from you. You can email us at: <a href="mailto:info@claphamchurch.org.uk">info@claphamchurch.org.uk</a></p>
