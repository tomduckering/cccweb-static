    <p>Thanks for visiting out website. Sadly we're not running a Sunday service in Clapham at the moment.</p>
    <p>We are however part of the <a href="http://co-mission.org.uk">Co-Mission network</a>. It's a family of good Bible teaching, Christ adoring churches in central and south west London. We'd be really happy to recommend some to you:</p>
    <ul>
